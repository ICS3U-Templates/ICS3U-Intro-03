**NOTE on Initial Load:**
- wait for the IDE to load completly
- click the "üîÅ" (Sync) button at the bottom left to pull down the changes I have made to the README.md file
- if you are coding in C/C++
  - remember to check the "extensions" and ensure all C/C++ extension have loaded before using
    - if they have not, click the "reload required" button until they do
  - when you run or debug a C/C++ program for the first time, the IDE will ask what compiler to use; select the 1st choice (C/C++: g++)
    - the IDE will place a task.json file in the .vscode directory

**NOTES on INITIAL LOAD:**
- wait for the IDE to load completly
- if you are coding in C/C++
  - when you run or debug a C/C++ program for the first time, the IDE will ask what compiler to use; select the 1st choice (C/C++: g++)
    - the IDE will place a task.json file in the .vscode directory

**REMEMBER:**
- ensure you commit your code after every major change, to keep your history
```console
  - git add -A
  - git commit -m "commit message"
  - git push origin main
```
